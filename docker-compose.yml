# Docker volumes are used to persist and manage data generated by and used by Docker containers.
# By default, any data created inside a container is lost when the container is removed.
# Volumes solve this problem by providing a way to store data outside the container's writable layer,
# ensuring that data is preserved even if the container is deleted or recreated.
